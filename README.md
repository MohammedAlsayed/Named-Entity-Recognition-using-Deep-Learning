# Introduction

This jupyter notebook shows the implementation of one of the deep learning models to predict the entity of a word. 

BiLSTM has been applied to predict the entity of a word. To enhance the simple BiLSTM, GloVe word2vec was used as word embeddings.

**Achieved 98% accuracy using BiLSTM and GloVe embeddings.**
